<h2>East Palo Alto</h2>
<p style="color: black"><strong>East Palo Alto</strong> is a small city in Silicon Valley. Be it by their unique culture, there large population of <strong>Hispanics and African-Americans</strong> living in East Palo Alto and Romic, a hazardous toxic waste plant that the community shut down a few years ago. It’s also a island of affordable housing surrounded by several of the most expensive housing markets in the nation. However, East Palo Alto rental prices are proliferating and our population is being demolished.
In 2012, it was considered that 25,000 families left East Palo Alto becasue they can't afford there homes anymore</p>
<h2>My Thesis</h2></p>
<p style="color: black">I believe that's absolutly unfair,in my opinion, because I'm a resident of East Palo Alto, and I don't like to see my community suffer because I cared about all of my <strong>friends</strong> and my <strong>family</strong> who have lived in East Palo Alto for their entire lives.
Thankfully, East Palo Alta owns <strong>San Mateo County Units</strong>, it was the largest stock in the Bay Area. As a result, Residents who still stayed in East Palo Alto live in those units. In Fact, a large number of residents who still live in East Palo Alto are <strong>renters</strong>, they don’t own houses.
</p>

<h2>What can YOU do to help?</h2>
<p style="color: black">The only way to better our community is by <strong>helping our neighborhoods and the problems that East Palo Alto is.</strong> <strong>Y.U.C.A</strong> (Youth United for Community Action),for example, is a <strong>grassroot community organization</strong> run by <strong>young people of color</strong> in East Palo Alto. They're mission is to <strong>demand equality and justice</strong> to provide a safe space for young people to empower themselves for East Palo Alto. Y.U.C.A has helped created and run the <strong>Equity Campaign</strong> to protect East Palo Alto housing and tenants, it lasted them 6 months of work with a coalition.
</p>
<h2>My Suggestion</h2><p style="color: black">My only belief is when East Palo Alto Residents who have little faith to alleviate their problems in the community,<strong> must stand up for East Palo Alto for good</strong>. The only solution is to example how intensive this is and show it to people outside of East Palo Alto to demonstrate how it affects our community.
That was my purpose that <strong>I created EPAHousingCrisis.com</strong> because <strong>I wanted people to read and see what I've prove to them what is happening in our community.</strong>
