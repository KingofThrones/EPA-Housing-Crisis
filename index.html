<h1 style="text-align: center;" div id="navbar" style="color: black">"East Palo Alto Housing Crisis" Written by: Carlos Cortez</h1> 






<h2>East Palo Alto</h2>
<p style="color: black">East Palo Alto is a small city in Silicon Valley. Be it by their unique culture, there is a huge population of hispanics and African-Americans living in East Palo Alto and Romic, a hazardous toxic waste plant in the community a few years ago. It’s also a island of affordable housing surrounded by several of the most expensive housing markets in the nation. However, East Palo Alto rental prices are proliferating and our population is being demolishing.
In 2012, it was 25,000 families left East Palo Alto becasue they can't afford there homes anymore</p>

<h2>My Thesis</h2></p>

<p style="color: black">I believe that’s an absolutely and incredibly unfortunate problem for me because I hate to see my community suffer because i cared about all of my friends and my family who live here for their entire lives. East Palo Alto owns and control San Mateo County Units, it was the largest stock in the Bay Area. As a result, Residents who still lives in East Palo Alto live in those units. Also, a large number of residents still live in East Palo Alto is because they’re <strong>renters</strong>, they don’t own houses.
</p>
<h2>E.Q.R</h2>

<p style="color: black"><strong>E.Q.R</strong>(Equity Residential) own all of the westside of EPA (1800 units of it.) They are the worst landlords in the face of the planet because they don’t believe in low income; They cared about making a profit(Money). They are the only people East Palo Alto Residents cannot interact because they use <strong>Gentrification</strong> to raised their rent to <strong>leverage</strong> their way to get people to leave their homes so the can have rich people to live in their homes. 
</p>

<h2>What can you do to help?</h2>

<p style="color: black">I learned how to better our community is by helping our neighborhoods and the problems that East Palo Alto is. Y.U.C.A (Youth United for Community Action),for example is a grassroot community organization run by young people of color in East Palo Alto. They’re mission is to demand equality and justice to provide a safe space for young people to empower themselves. Y.U.C.A  has helped created and run the Equity Campaign to protect and alternate our housing and tenants, it lasted them 6 months of work with a coalition.
</p>

<h2>My Suggestion</h2><p style="color: black">I strongly believe that people in East Palo Alto can’t alleviate the problems in their community, unless they see it. The only solution is to example how intensive this is and show it to people outside of East Palo Alto to demonstrate how it affects our community.
That why I, the owner, created EPAHouseCrisis.com because I wanted people it see what is happening in East PAlo Alto and attrach people to stand up for us to help us represent our city.
