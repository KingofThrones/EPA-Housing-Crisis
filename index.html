<h2>East Palo Alto</h2>
<p style="color: black"><strong>East Palo Alto</strong> is a small city in Silicon Valley. Be it by their unique culture, there is a huge population of <strong>Hispanics and African-Americans</strong> living in East Palo Alto and Romic, a hazardous toxic waste plant that the community shut down a few years ago. It’s also a island of affordable housing surrounded by several of the most expensive housing markets in the nation. However, East Palo Alto rental prices are proliferating and our population is being demolishing.
In 2012, it was 25,000 families left East Palo Alto becasue they can't afford there homes anymore</p>

<h2>My Thesis</h2></p>

<p style="color: black">I believe that’s an absolutely and incredibly unfortunate conflict,to me, because I hate to see my community struggle because I cared for all of my <strong>friends</strong> and my <strong>family</strong> who live in East Palo Alto for their entire lives. East Palo Alto owns and control <strong>San Mateo County Units</strong>, it was the largest stock in the Bay Area. As a result, Residents who still stayed in East Palo Alto live in those units. In Fact, a large number of residents who still live in East Palo Alto are <strong>renters</strong>, they don’t own houses.
</p>
<h2>E.Q.R</h2>

<p style="color: black"><strong>E.Q.R</strong> (Equity Residential) are landlords who own all of the westside of EPA (1800 units of it.) But they don’t believe in <strong>low income</strong>;They use <strong>Gentrification</strong> to raised their rent to <strong>leverage</strong> their way to get people to leave their homes so the can let rich people to live in their homes. 
</p>

<h2>What can YOU do to help?</h2>

<p style="color: black">The only way to better our community is by helping our neighborhoods and the problems that East Palo Alto is. <strong>Y.U.C.A</strong> (Youth United for Community Action),for example is a <strong>grassroot community organization</strong> run by <strong>young people of color</strong> in East Palo Alto. They’re mission is to <strong>demand equality and justice</strong> to provide a safe space for young people to empower themselves in East Palo Alto. Y.U.C.A  has helped created and run the <strong>Equity Campaign</strong> to protect and alternate our housing and tenants, it lasted them 6 months of work with a coalition.
</p>

<h2>My Suggestion</h2><p style="color: black">I strongly believe that people in East Palo Alto can’t alleviate the problems in their community, <strong>unless they see it</strong>. The only solution is to example how intensive this is and show it to people outside of East Palo Alto to demonstrate how it affects our community.
That was the purpose that <strong>I created EPAHousingCrisis.com</strong> because <strong>I wanted people it see what is happening in our community and allow people to stand up for our community to help us make our voices heard.</strong>
